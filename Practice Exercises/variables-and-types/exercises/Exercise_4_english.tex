\begin{exercise}
This exercise reviews the flow of execution through a program
with multiple methods.  Read the following code and answer the
questions below.

\begin{verbatim}

   #include <stdio.h>
   #include <stdlib.h>

   void Zippo (int quince, int flag);

   void Baffle (int output)
    {
       printf ("%i\n",output);
       Zippo (12, -5);
     }
 
    void Zippo (int quince, int flag)
    {
       if (flag < 0)
       {
             printf ("%i zoop\n", quince);
       }
       else
       {
          printf ("rattle ");
          Baffle (quince);
          printf ("boo-wa-ha-ha\n");
         }
     }
 
     int main (void)
     {
         Zippo (5, 13);
         return EXIT_SUCCESS;
     }


\end{verbatim}

\begin{enumerate}

\item Write the number {\tt 1} next to the first {\em statement}
of this program that will be executed.  Be careful to distinguish
things that are statements from things that are not.

\item Write the number {\tt 2} next to the second statement, and so on
until the end of the program.  If a statement is executed more than
once, it might end up with more than one number next to it.

\item What is the value of the parameter {\tt blimp} when {\tt baffle()}
gets invoked?

\item What is the output of this program?

\end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}


\begin{exercise}
The first verse of the song ``99 Bottles of Beer'' is:

\begin{quote}
99 bottles of beer on the wall,
99 bottles of beer,
ya' take one down, ya' pass it around,
98 bottles of beer on the wall.
\end{quote}

Subsequent verses are identical except that the number
of bottles gets smaller by one in each verse, until the
last verse:

\begin{quote}
No bottles of beer on the wall,
no bottles of beer,
ya' can't take one down, ya' can't pass it around,
'cause there are no more bottles of beer on the wall!
\end{quote}
%
And then the song (finally) ends.

Write a program that prints the entire lyrics of
``99 Bottles of Beer.''  Your program should include a
recursive method that does the hard part, but you also
might want to write additional methods to separate the major
functions of the program.

As you are developing your code, you will probably
want to test it with a small number of verses, like
``3 Bottles of Beer.''

The purpose of this exercise is to take a problem and break it
into smaller problems, and to solve the smaller problems by writing
simple, easily-debugged methods.

\begin{exercise}
You can use the  {\tt getchar()} function in C to
get character input from the user through the keyboard.
This function stops the execution of the program and waits
for the input from the user. 

The {\tt getchar()} function has the type {\tt int} and does
not require an argument. It returns the ASCII-Code (cf. Appendix~\ref{ASCII-Table})
of the key that has been pressed on the keyboard.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Write a program, that asks the user 
to input a digit between  0 and 9. 

\item Test the input from the user and display an error message 
if the returned value is not a digit. The program should then
be terminated.
If the test is successful, the program should print the 
input value on the computer screen.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{exercise}
Fermat's Last Theorem says that there are no integers
$a$, $b$, and $c$ such that

\[a^n + b^n = c^n \]
%
except in the case when $n=2$.

Write a function named {\tt checkFermat()} that takes four
integers as parameters---{\tt a}, {\tt b}, {\tt c} and {\tt n}---and
that checks to see if Fermat's theorem holds.  If
$n$ is greater than 2 and it turns out to be true that 
$a^n + b^n = c^n$,
the program should print ``Holy smokes, Fermat was wrong!''
Otherwise the program should print ``No, that doesn't work.''

You should assume that there is a function named {\tt raiseToPow()}
that takes two integers as arguments and that raises the
first argument to the power of the second.  For example:

\begin{verbatim}
    int x = raiseToPow (2, 3);
\end{verbatim}
%
would assign the value {\tt 8} to {\tt x}, because $2^3 = 8$.
